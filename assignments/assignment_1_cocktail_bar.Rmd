# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktails_all <-read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
sep <- c("<br/>", "<br>", "<b4/>")
quantities <- c(".*oz", ".*dashes", ".*dash", ".*drops", ".*drop", ".*bsp", "\\([^\\)]+\\)", ".*es")

for (separator in sep) {
  cocktails_all <- cocktails_all %>% 
  separate_longer_delim(ingredients, delim = separator)
}

for (quantity in quantities) {
  cocktails_all <- cocktails_all %>%
    mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, quantity, ""))
}
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredient_list <- cocktails_all %>% 
  distinct(trimws(ingredients)) %>% 
  rename(ingredients = `trimws(ingredients)`) %>% 
  arrange(ingredients)

glimpse(ingredient_list)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
sum_ingr <- nrow(ingredient_list)

cat("The total number of distinct variables needed is :", sum_ingr) #ans: 62
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
freq_ingr <- cocktails_all %>% 
  group_by(trimws(ingredients)) %>% 
  summarize(frequency = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(frequency))%>% 
  rename(ingredients = `trimws(ingredients)`)

head(freq_ingr, 10)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
count(ingredient_list)

cocktail_most <- cocktails_all %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(ingnum = n()) %>% 
  top_n(n=1)

head(cocktail_most)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
cocktail_ing <- cocktails_all %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarize(ingnum = n()) %>% 
  filter(ingnum == "1")

print(cocktail_ing) #ans: 0
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
one_ingr <- freq_ingr %>%
  filter(frequency == 1) %>%
  pull(ingredients)

one_ingr_cockt <- cocktails_all %>%
  filter(trimws(ingredients) %in% one_ingr)%>%
  pull(name)

print(one_ingr_cockt)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
notrare_cockt <- cocktails_all %>%
  filter(!(name %in% one_ingr_cockt))%>%
  pull(name) %>% 
  unique()

print(notrare_cockt)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
cocktail_matrix <- cocktails_all %>%
  select(name, ingredients) %>% 
  summarize(ingredients = trimws(ingredients),
            name = name) %>% 
  mutate(value = 1)

cocktail_list <- cocktail_matrix %>% 
  pull(name) %>% 
  unique()

ingredient_list <- cocktail_matrix %>% 
  pull(ingredients) %>% 
  unique()

mtrx_c <- with(cocktail_matrix, tapply(value, list(name, ingredients), FUN = mean))
finalmatrx <- matrix(ifelse(mtrx_c == 1, "X", ""), ncol = length(ingredient_list), dimnames = list(cocktail_list, ingredient_list))

print(finalmatrx)
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
